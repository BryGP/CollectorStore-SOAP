A SOAP service is a web service that is created from different tools, such as:
- XSD files
- WSDL generate

And it serves to have a stable communication with a local server, in this case you can access this small service remotely with the devices connected to the network, or on the same wired and local interface for testing. Likewise, it is good to comment that it deals with:
- Software that can run SOAP services (SOAP UI,Apache CXF,Microsoft WCF).

This project is simple, it is a collectible toy store, it is just a sample of how the products work: add them, delete them, modify them and add a new one.
